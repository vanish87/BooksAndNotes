1. P19  
 The length of the projection of the vector P onto the vector Q is given by
P⋅Q/|Q| because P⋅Q = |P||Q|cosα.
2. P23  
The right hand rule provides a way for determining in which direction the
cross product points. When the vectors P and Q are interchanged, their cross product is
negated.

4. P68  
 An invertible n × n matrix M is called orthogonal if and only if
M−1 =MT.
5. P70  
If(V1xV2)⋅V3<0, then the basis is left-handed.

 * Transforming Normal Vectors
 * Translation, rotation, and reflection are the only orthogonal transformations. A matrix that has a scale applied to it is no longer orthogonal.

The mapping to homogenous clip space is performed by first using a 4× 4
projection matrix that, among other actions, places the negative z coordinate of a
camera-space point into the w coordinate of the transformed point. Subsequent
division by the w coordinate produces a three-dimensional point having normalized
device coordinates.
